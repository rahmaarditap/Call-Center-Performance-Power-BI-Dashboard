# Call Center Performance Power BI Dashboard

## Introduction
For my recent task from the PwC Switzerland Power BI Virtual Case Experience on Forage, I created a comprehensive call center performance dashboard using Power BI and DAX. This dashboard provides a detailed overview of key metrics and insights, empowering management to make strategies for PhoneNow, telecommunication company. 

The Call Center Performance Dashboard is designed to present key performance indicators (KPIs) and detailed visualizations that offer a clear view of call center operations. The KPIs include:
- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Overal resolved/unresolved case status
- Calls by time
- Average speed of answer
- Agentâ€™s performance quadrant
- The dashboard aims to help managers understand trends, identify areas for improvement, and implement strategies for enhancing call center performance.
