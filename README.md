## Introduction
For my recent task from the PwC Switzerland Power BI Virtual Case Experience on Forage, I created a comprehensive call center performance dashboard using Power BI and DAX. This dashboard provides a detailed overview of key metrics and insights, empowering management to make strategies for PhoneNow, telecommunication company. 

The Call Center Performance Dashboard is designed to present key performance indicators (KPIs) and detailed visualizations that offer a clear view of call center operations. The KPIs include:
- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Overal resolved/unresolved case status
- Calls by time
- Average speed of answer
- Agent’s performance quadrant
- The dashboard aims to help managers understand trends, identify areas for improvement, and implement strategies for enhancing call center performance.

### Insight
From the dashboard, we know that:
- **Total Calls**: PhoneNow received a total of 5000 calls during this period.
- **Answered Calls**: Out of 5000 calls, 4054 calls were answered (81.08%). This is a good sign of PhoneNow responsiveness.
- **Abandoned Calls**: PhoneNow had 946 abandoned calls (18.92%). This is an area PhoneNow need to focus on because abandoned calls can lead to customer dissatisfaction.Resolved Cases: This pie chart indicates that 72.92% of the answered calls were resolved. Improving this metric is crucial as it directly impacts customer satisfaction.
- **Average Speed of Answer**: The average time taken to answer a call was 67.52 seconds. While this is within acceptable limits, there is room for improvement to enhance customer experience.
- **Average Talk Duration**: The average duration of a call was 3.75 minutes.
- **Average Satisfaction Rating** is 3.40, as shown by the gauge. This indicates that while many customers are content, there is a need for improvement in service quality.
- **Total Calls by Month**: PhoneNow had a total calls peak in January, followed by a decline in February and March. This information helps PhoneNow to understand seasonal trends and plan resource allocation accordingly.

### Recommendation
Based on these visualizations, here are some recommendations:
- **Resource Allocation**: we should consider optimizing staffing levels to handle peak periods more effectively, which is on January. This could help reduce the number of abandoned calls and improve our answer rate.
- **Training and Developmen**t: Targeted training programs for the agents to improve resolution rate and customer satisfaction. This could include training on specific call topics that has lowest satisfaction rating and customer interaction techniques.
- **Customer Feedback**: Implementing targeted feedback initiatives to help us understand the reasons behind the dissatisfaction ratings and take corrective actions. This could help enhance PhoneNow service quality and overall customer satisfaction.
